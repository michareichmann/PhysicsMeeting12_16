	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{\fill}
		\item High Luminosity LHC requires a new detector technology due to the highly increased radiation damage 
		\item diamond detector designs viable option due to its radiation tolerance, among other advantages
		\item scCVD diamonds not suitable due to signal dependence on particle flux after irradiation
		\item pCVD diamonds show no rate dependence up to fluxes of \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per cm^2} and irradiations up to \SI{1e16}{neq\per cm^2}
		\item successfully proven the working principle of a 3D diamond detector
		\item tested the very first 3D-Pixel detector
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{\underline{Ultimate Goal:}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item build fully working pixel detector
	\end{itemize}
