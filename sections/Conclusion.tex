	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength{\itemsep}{\fill}
		\item High Luminosity LHC requires a new detector technology due to the highly increased radiation damage 
		\item diamond detector designs viable option due to its radiation tolerance, among other advantages
% 		\item scCVD diamonds not suitable due to signal dependence on particle flux after irradiation
		\item pCVD diamonds show no rate dependence up to fluxes of \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per cm^2} and irradiations up to \SI{2e15}{neq\per cm^2}
		\item plan to publish results soon
		\item successfully proven the working principle of a 3D diamond detector
		\item tested the very first 3D-Pixel detector
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{\underline{Ultimate Goal:}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item build fully working pixel detector module
	\end{itemize}
